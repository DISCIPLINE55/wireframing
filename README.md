## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes are visual guides that represent the skeletal framework of a website or digital product. They help designers, stakeholders, and developers focus on layout, structure, and functionality without getting distracted by colors, fonts, or detailed visuals. There are two main types of wireframes: **Low-Fidelity** and **High-Fidelity**.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Definition:** Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, basic representations of a page layout, often created with paper and pen or simple digital tools.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Grayscale with minimal design elements.
  - Focus on layout, hierarchy, and high-level interactions.
  - UI elements and content represented by simple shapes (squares, rectangles, lines).
- **Use Cases:** 
  - Early stages of the design process.
  - Quickly testing layout and structure.
  - Gathering feedback from stakeholders without distraction from visual details.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Definition:** High-fidelity wireframes are more detailed and visually closer to the final product.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Include realistic UI elements, branding, colors, and typography.
  - Can include images, icons, and detailed copy.
  - Represents visual hierarchy and precise placement of elements.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Later stages of design before prototype creation.
  - Communicating detailed interactions and visual cues.
  - Aligning designers, developers, and stakeholders on the final interface.

## Identifying the Type of Wireframe

The wireframe provided in the reference example is a **low-fidelity wireframe**, because:

- It uses simple grey boxes and shapes to represent UI elements like images and videos.
- Focuses on layout and structure rather than colors, branding, or detailed graphics.
- Serves as a blueprint to communicate functionality and positioning without exact design details.
